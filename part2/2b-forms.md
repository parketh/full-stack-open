# Part 2 - (b) Forms

## Controlled components

Controlled components are used in HTML forms to store the contents of a form and notify changes through callbacks like `onChange`. To set this up: 

 - the value of the form input can be stored in the `App` component's state with the `useState` function; the initial state of the notes array is passed in as a prop to the `App` component
