# Part 1 - (b) JavaScript

## Introduction

Browsers do not yet support all of JavaScript's latest features, and a lot of code run in browsers is *transpiled* (usually using [Babel](https://babeljs.io/)) to an older, more compatible version.

`Node.js` is a JavaScript runtime environment based on Google's Chrome V8 JavaScript engine and works practically everywhere. `Node.js` is run using the command:

```javascript
node name_of_file.js
```

## Variables

There are two ways to go about defining variables in JavaScript:
 - `const` which is immutable
 - `let` which is mutable
